# Excel-Macros-for-automation-at-Work

1. The schedule for about 80 staff with differnt capabelites across different location is managed using the excel file which was very difficult to interpret (Sheet: Master)

  I needed to manage about 50 staff only across certain location on day to day basis and create a daily report with staff count as well as suggest the long term schedule with certain minimum numbers 

  I created a excel Macro that parses the original schedule and creates the graphical view with daily staff count on each location and difeerntiate the capbelities using color  (Exluding certain staff) (Sheet : Graphic)

2. I would get the Longterm flight schedule for summer and winter about 180 pages long PDF. My job was to create a long term report forcasting each day including Total Aircraft across stations  , First- Last Arrival/Deperture/Turnarouunds.

3. I would get the 10 days  schedule for each station on 5 PDF files. My job was to create a report forcasting each day including Total Aircraft across stations  , First- Last Arrival/Deperture/Turnarouunds and Registration of each Aircraft(Hidden Column)

  I converted the PDF to Excel File and created the Macro to get and Parse the data with press of button instead of manual count.
